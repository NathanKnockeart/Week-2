##What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
  1. Information Gathering - Gather information on what kind of website you want to create. Then make goals and find out your target audience. Lastly find out what kind of information you want your target audience to see
  2. Planning - I feel that step 1 and 2 go together. If you gather your information correctly then you should have a plan on what you are going to do with that info and plan accordingly.
  3. Design - Designing your website should be based on who will be seeing it. So if your making a site for a younger generation, you might want to make things colorful and tech savvy. While an older generation would probably perfer a blander website that is easy to read.
  4. Development - This is where you create your website. 
  5. Testing and Delivery - You should be almost done with that website at this point, therefore it should be tested to see if everything is working properly. After everything has be checked and running smoothly, you should launch the site to the public.
  6. Maintenance - This step is self-explainitory. Fix any bugs/technically issues or add additional content in-order to keep your visitors intreged. 
##What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
  My sites goal is provide users with all the information they need to know about my companies business or my business. My site will feature details on what im selling, how to contact us, and everything they need to know about the business.
##What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
  Well say I am making a website for a donut shop. My target audience would probably targeted to younger individuals.They would more than likely be interested in a website with a more vibrant color scheme and pops out more than say a news site. 
##What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
  The primary action I would want my visitors to take is visiting my menu. 
##What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
  The main things that someone should know about design and user experience are as follows: How it makes your visiters feel, Ease of access, and can it be accessed from any device.
##What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
  The user experience design is basically how someone feels about your website. This is valuable because if nobody likes the feel of you site, they will not return or mention it to there peers.
##Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious? The only part that was tedious was reading an entire webpage, but it was valuble info. So im cool with it.
